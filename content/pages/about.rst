This is the second reincarnation of my personal blog, hosted in `Github pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_ since 2014.

Here, I expect to record my steps in the long (and potentially infinite) journey to become a better Software Engineer,
as well as my personal projects, thoughts and experiences (of any kind).

And I promise I will publish more than one post this time! *\*crosses his fingers\**
