        <h2> Education </h2>
        First and foremost, I am a Computer Scientist (that was a 5 years career in Spain at that time). Then I coursed a two years Biomedical Engineering master. Finally I enrolled a PhD in Biomedicine. But sin importar el t√≠tulo, I remain an expert software developer 
        
        
        <h2>Software development skills</h2>
        
        Software development - Design (from basic UML to some newer iterative methodologies like TDD)
        Testing (unit testing, integration and regression tests in several languages), automation (ex. using vagrant), light scripting, 
        
        Always worked under Linux
            
        
        C++ and Python
        
        Other languages
            Java- carrera y Android more recently.
            Learning new languages is easy, specially because most of the time it just means re. But I do not consider myself to have a good degree of expertise. 
       
        
        DBs
        sound Design (which if you make me do it in a paper I will do using UML, as we were tough in the faculty). at some point I have used SQLlite, mySQL and more recently PostgreSQL, including the creation of processes 
        
        
        Data science
        hobby
        self-learning coursera, books
        Data science, machine learning with special atention to clustering and PCA techniques (during my PhD), web scrapping using scrappy and perl XXX.
        
        you can find my repositories. Unfortunately the best works are not open source and it is currently used by http://nostrumbiodiscovery.com/ 


        Work experience
        
        worked basicly for academia last 9 years a lately my role was the research software engineer (http://www.rse.ac.uk/who.html). What does a research software engineer do? 
        the basic protocol is
        understanding the background and the problem
        find innovative algorithms/solutions to the problems
        Develop the software implementing the new algorithms
        writing research papers
        
        Were the deeveloping part is the most expensive
        
        
        CV
        expanded titles
